            <b>Satoru Gojo</b> (五ご条じょう悟さとる Gojō Satoru?) is one of the main
            protagonists of the Jujutsu Kaisen series. He is a special grade
            jujutsu sorcerer and widely recognized as the strongest in the world.
            Satoru is the pride of the Gojo Clan, the first person to inherit both
            the Limitless and the Six Eyes in four hundred years. He works as a
            teacher at the Tokyo Jujutsu High and uses his influence to protect
            and train strong young allies.

          <h2>Apperiance</h2>
          <p>
            Satoru is a very tall, lean and muscular man who is in his late
            twenties and is considered relatively attractive, mainly due to his
            facial features. He has snow-white hair and the Six Eyes, which are
            a vibrant blue color. Satoru normally covers his eyes with a black
            blindfold which props up his hair and gives it a spikier appearance.
            When sporting a more casual look, Satoru will wear sunglasses and
            let his hair down to reach the base of his neck.
          </p>
          <p>
            While working, Satoru wears a dark blue zip-up jacket with a high
            collar that's also fairly wide. He wears slim-fit matching black
            pants and black dress boots. Before switching over to a simple
            blindfold, Satoru used to wear bandages over his eyes. Satoru enjoys
            wearing expensive clothing[7] and has a number of casual looks he'll
            pair with wearing his sunglasses. As a Tokyo Jujutsu High student,
            Satoru wore the normal school uniform with his sunglasses before
            adopting any sort of makeshift blindfold.

          <h2>Personality</h2>
          <p>
            Satoru is a complex individual. He is normally seen to be nonchalant
            and playful towards his students, close colleagues, and friends.
            However, he is unsympathetic and cruel towards sorcerer executives,
            an example being his blatant disrespect towards Principal Gakuganji,
            and his enemies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Satoru is extremely confident in his abilities and reputation as a
            powerful sorcerer, believing himself to be invincible. His opinion
            of others often only go as far as his judgement of their strength,
            and he is quite apathetic towards anyone he deems weak.
            Additionally, greatly influenced by his own desire for power, he is
            very arrogant. He is convinced that he is the strongest in the
            world, which he technically is, claiming, during his fight with Toji
            Fushiguro, that "throughout the Heavens and earth, he alone is the
            honored one." This can be further exemplified when he was tasked
            with protecting Riko Amanai, one of the few 'weak' people he
            genuinely grew to show compassion for. However, any empathy of her
            death was soon negated by his extensive amount of pride and
            arrogance after perfecting his reverse cursed technique in his
            following battle against Toji Fushiguro.
          </p>
          <p>
            During intense battles, Satoru is seen to occasionally fall into a
            frenzied fighting state, urged by his determination for victory and
            undeniable proof that he alone is the strongest. His combative style
            is characterized by his aggressive and domineering attacks, while
            flaunting his mastered techniques to his opponents. Furthermore, in
            a crisis, he is capable of being cold-blooded. He will prioritize
            his enemies' destruction over saving innocent people when he
            believes that the sacrifice is unavoidable. However, this only
            extends to the people killed by his opponent; he will not do any
            lasting harm to or kill anyone innocent to gain the upper hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, despite his haughtiness and strength, Satoru is more
            human than he first appears. After defeating Toji, Satoru retrieved
            Riko's corpse with a sorrowful look, showing that albeit his recent
            conceited victory temporarily clouding his feelings, he still felt
            some grief over her death. He sought to kill the Star Religious
            Group members that were laughing over Riko's death, though was
            stopped by Suguru Geto — who he relied on as a moral compass at that
            time — before taking any action. Furthermore, Satoru was later left
            visibly horrified and panicked after learning that Suguru, his one
            and only best friend, had become a murderous curse user. Satoru
            attempted to reason with his friend, but eventually realized and
            accepted that he lost the one person he truly saw as an equal. After
            having to put an end to Suguru before more calamity arose, it was
            Satoru's trauma over losing his best friend that caused his ultimate
            downfall in Shibuya. He was also distraught when Yuji seemingly
            died.
          </p>
          <p>
            Satoru's endgame is to reform the jujutsu world from the bottom-up
            through education. He seeks to foster a new generation of sorcerers
            that he hopes will one day become his equals.
